This is the README file for my capstone project in the UCA College of Science and Engineering as a Physics major Spring 2026.

Flowchart of model testing:
1. Pull in data from uca eclipse and NEU eclipse
2. Adjust neu data to match uca timing
3. set up these functions for comparison with simulated eclipse

Now is the time for iterations of the model
4. Generate a version of the model for testing
5. Create lightcurve from this model
6. Compare this theoretical lightcurve with an observed lightcurve
7. rate the changed variable to determine if the change to the model was more or less accurate.
8. repeat for as many intervals/variables as nessicary.
