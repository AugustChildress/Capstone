observation_log.xlsx:

The Excel file contains date/time, coordinates, and the solar flux. The tracking software had to be restarted during the live stream event, so there are a few missing / problematic data points. The problematic data points are highlighted in yellow and should be discarded.




npz files:

Each file contains five 1-second averaged power spectra in the range of 1421–1423 MHz. These are binary files with only the power values (no frequency), saved as 32-bit float numbers. The FFT size was 4096. There are five spectra saved back-to-back, resulting in 4096 x 5 = 20,480 32-bit numbers in each file. The flux values in the log file were calculated by integrating over a smaller portion of the recorded 2 MHz band.
